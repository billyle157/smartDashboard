# smartDashboard

This dashboard uses a dot density map where each dot represents one vehicle break-in incident in San Francisco in 2025. I chose this approach because the data represent individual point events rather than aggregated area data, making a dot density map more appropriate than a choropleth or proportional symbol map for showing the spatial distribution of individual incidents. I don't think I had the knowledge to turn this data into a proportional symbol map, and so I chose to stick with my representation and focused on the main goal which is to create a Dashboard.
